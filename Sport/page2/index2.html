      <h5>Tennis</h5>
      <div class="infaWords">
         <h6>History</h6>
         <p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was
            struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm"),
            which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in
            the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts
            made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". In due course this design spread across royal palaces
            all over Europe.
         <p>In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large
            quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also
            suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis
            player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a
            court set up at the Louvre Palace.
         <p>It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from
            the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an interjection used as a
            call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only
            played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game,
            which is now known as real tennis.</p>

      <h5>Football</h5>
      <div class="infaWords">
         <h6>History</h6>
         <p>Ball games have been played in many countries. In China, such a variety was called Zhu-Ke. In ancient
            Sparta, the game was called "Episkiros", in ancient Rome "Harpastum". Around the XIV century, the Italians
            invented the game "Calcio". It was they who brought this game to the British Isles.
         <p>In the XIX century, football in England gained popularity comparable to cricket. It was played mostly in
            colleges. In some colleges, the rules allowed holding and passing the ball with their hands, in others, on
            the contrary, it was prohibited. The first attempt to create uniform rules was made in 1846, when
            representatives of several colleges met. They established the first set of rules. In 1857, the first
            specialized football club was founded — Sheffield. In 1863, after long negotiations, the code of rules of
            the Football Association of England was adopted. The dimensions of the field and gate were also adopted. And
            in 1871, the FA Cup was founded — the oldest football tournament in the world. In 1891, the penalty shootout
            rule was adopted. But at first the penalty was not beaten from the point, but from the line, which, just
            like now, was at a distance of 11 meters from the goal</p>

      <h5>Kazakh wrestling</h5>
      <div class="infaWords">
         <h6>History</h6>
         <p>The earliest rock paintings of Kazakh wrestling can be traced back to 1200 to 600 BC. Kazakh wrestling was a
            central part of military training in an age in which battles were fought on chariots. A soldier had to
            possess excellent balance while standing on a chariot and fighting using spear and bow. Another point was
            that a soldier had to be skillful using both the right and left hand as an opponent could be on his right or
            left while driving a chariot. The purpose of wrestling seemed to be threefold.</p>
         <p>Kazakh wrestling was introduced by Kazakh people back in ancient times. The winner of Kazakh wrestling earns
            greater respect from the people. For example, Kazhymykan Munaitpasov was a well-known Kazakh wrestler who
            made it on the world sports' fame list for his achievements.</p>
         <h6>Techniques:</h6>
         <p>Designed for close combat the techniques were aimed at knocking an opponent off balance from a standing
            position. This allowed a soldier to use fighting techniques in a real battle at close proximity, when he had
            a weapon in his hands. The Techniques and methods used in Kazakh wrestling have strong similarities with the
            ones found in Judo and Mongolian wrestling. Victory is achieved when the opponent is thrown flat on the
            back. Points can also be achieved by throwing the opponent on the side or forcing him to a knee. The goal of
            Kazakh wrestling is to throw the opponent on the floor while remaining standing or falling atop of him. As a
            result of this sacrifice throws and throws that cause the thrower to drop to one or two knees are not
            favored. The wrestlers are not allowed to touch the legs but can freely grab the jacket and the belt of the
            opponent.</p>
